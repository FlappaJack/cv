        <br>
        <p>I am a Griffith University graduate with a Bachelors degree in Multimedia with a Major in Marketing.  I have worked in sales, customer service and hospitality and have work experience in marketing in the not-for-profit sector with the RSPCA. During 2020 – when COVID limited job opportunities – I volunteered at Meals On Wheels and have worked at iconic Brisbane venue Blackbird part-time since August last year.  I am able to communicate with people from all backgrounds, manage my time and work in a team or independently to meet objectives. As you can see from my resume, I’ve done a bit of everything since uni and I’m hopeful my next role will be as part of a team where I can further develop the skills I learned at Griffith.</p> </td>
